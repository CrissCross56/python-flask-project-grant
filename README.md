# This small project I made is just an sql data base that stores information on my Freecompany from FF14. Each "avatar" has a name, job, and rank.

# In order to get all members of the FC, use the /avatars end-point. Use the same endpoint to post a new memeber to the FC as well.
# In order to update and delete use the /avatars/:id endpoint, iwth :id being the id of a member of the FC
